      NXBoot enables running custom boot code on Tegra X1 devices such as the Nintendo Switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Batteries are not included: This application does not contain any payloads, so you will have to download and import some first.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is recommended that you become familiar with the Nintendo Switch homebrew community prior to using this application.
      Early boot code has full access to the device it runs on and can damage it.
      Nintendo is known to ban modified devices from online services if such modification is detected.

      An OTG adapter is required for connecting your iOS device to the Nintendo Switch. The following configuration is known work:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple Lightning USB Camera Adapter on the iOS device, connected to...</li>
      <li>any USB 3 Type A  male to USB 3 Type C male cable, connected to...</li>
      <Li>the Nintendo Switch</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A direct Lightning to USB 3 Type C cable (without OTG adapter in between) does not work.
      Third-party OTG adapters <i>may</i> work, but your mileage may vary.
    </p>

    <h1 id="section-importing-boot-code">Importing Boot Code</h1>
    <p>
      There are multiple methods for importing payloads:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Copy the file into the app's Documents/Payloads folder via SSH.</li>
      <li>Use the iOS files browser to import the payload from local or cloud storage.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Create Boot Profiles by tapping the <i>Edit</i> button and selecting <i>Add Payload</i>.
    </p>

    <h1 id="section-booting">Booting the Target Device</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Tap your payload after importing it once.</li>
      <li>Enter RCM mode on the Nintendo Switch.</li>
      <li>Connect the Nintendo Switch via USB.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A warning about an unsupported accessory appears and can be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always power on the Nintendo Switch prior to connecting it. Otherwise iOS will disconnect the device for consuming too much power.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enter RCM mode by 1. shorting the home pin to a ground pin on the right Joy-Con rail, 2. holding down Volume +, 3. tapping the POWER button once.</li>
      <li>In RCM the screen remains black, but the device is detected as 'APX' by PCs and will work with this app.</li>
      <li>Exit RCM mode without booting custom code by holding the POWER button for 12 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
